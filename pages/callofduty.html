Heres how to play:- Call of Duty is a first-person shooter military video game series and media franchise published by Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, was released on November 14, 2025.

The series originally focused on a World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) and Treyarch developing Call of Duty 3 (2006). Infinity Ward's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series; a Modern Warfare remastered version was released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, Modern Warfare II in 2022, and Modern Warfare III in 2023. Infinity Ward has also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016).

Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Six more entries, Black Ops II (2012), Black Ops III (2015), Black Ops 4 (2018), Black Ops Cold War (2020), Black Ops 6 (2024), and Black Ops 7 (2025) were made, the latter three in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, which were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced Warfare (2014), WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021). They are also the lead developer for Modern Warfare III (2023), the third entry in the Modern Warfare reboot sub-series.

As of October 2023, Call of Duty has sold over 500 million copies and has 100 million monthly active players across all platforms.[1][2] The franchise generated $30 billion in revenue by 2022.[3] The series is verified by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling first-person shooter game series. It is also the most successful video game franchise created in the United States and the third best-selling video game franchise of all time. Other products in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan B Toys, a card game created by Upper Deck Company, Mega Bloks sets by Mega Brands, and a comic book miniseries published by WildStorm Productions, and a feature film in development.

Canceled titles
Call of Duty: Combined Forces
Call of Duty: Combined Forces was a proposed concept draft originally intended to be a sequel to Call of Duty: Finest Hour. However, due to multiple legal issues that arose between Spark Unlimited, Electronic Arts, and Activision as well as other production problems, the game's draft and scripts never came to be. The game was projected to cost $10.5 million to produce after Finest Hour was complete. Eventually, Activision deemed the pitch as more of an expansion than something entirely new, causing the company to reject the proposal and end their contract with Spark Unlimited shortly after.[67]

Call of Duty: Devil's Brigade
Call of Duty: Devil's Brigade was a canceled first-person shooter for the Xbox 360 developed by Underground Entertainment. The game was set in World War II, mainly focusing on the Italian Campaign.[68]

Call of Duty: Future Warfare / NX1
In 2010, after the fracturing of Infinity Ward and departure of Jason West and Vince Zampella, studio Neversoft was tasked by Activision to develop a sci-fi spinoff in the Call of Duty franchise, experimenting with low-gravity gameplay and other aspects of the engine. At an unknown point in time, the project was scrapped, and assets were reused in Ghosts and Infinite Warfare. Footage of the project (known as Future Warfare) was leaked online in January 2024, revealing a complete opening mission, and an in-development multiplayer that was still reusing assets from 2009's Modern Warfare 2. After the leaks, former Neversoft developer Brian Bright came along and confirmed the leaks, stating that the game had two or three complete missions, and a large amount of multiplayer work done. He also referred to the project as "NX1", and that the game was meant to be released in 2013 in place of Ghosts.[69][70]

Call of Duty: Vietnam
Call of Duty: Vietnam was a third-person shooter set during the Vietnam War. It was in development for at least six to eight months at Sledgehammer Games. The development was stopped because Infinity Ward needed help finishing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 due to the employee firings and departures in 2010.[71][72]

Call of Duty: Roman Wars
Call of Duty: Roman Wars was a canceled third and first-person video game in the Call of Duty franchise developed by Vicarious Visions. The game was set in ancient Rome, and allowed players to take control of famous historical figure Julius Caesar, along with "low grunts", and officers of the Tenth Legion. It was eventually canceled, as Activision had uncertainties about branding it as a Call of Duty title.[73]

Untitled Call of Duty Zombies game
Between 2012 and 2013, Raven Software was developing a stand-alone Call of Duty Zombies game, after Treyarch's internal decision to move from the traditional Black Ops Zombies mode and focusing on the single-player and multiplayer aspects of their next game, Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015). Designed to be a free-to-play arena, the game was taking inspirations from the Mad Max movies. Former Raven's lead designer Michael Gulmmelt came along and confirmed the leaks in April 2024, and revealed that Raven canceled the project after Treyarch move back on the production of Black Ops Zombies and decided that Raven's game would create an internal competition.[74]

Merchandise
In 2004, Activision, in cooperation with the companies Plan-B Toys and Radioactive Clown, released the "Call of Duty: Series 1" line of action figures, which included three American soldiers and three German soldiers from the World War II era.[77] While the American G.I. action figure was made in 2004,[78] Plan-B Toys later discontinued a controversial Nazi SS Guard action figure based on the Nazi Totenkopf officer seen in Call of Duty.[79] In 2008, McFarlane Toys announced their partnership with Activision to produce action figures for the Call of Duty series. McFarlane Toys' first series of action figures were released in October 2008 and consists of four different figures: Marine with Flamethrower, Marine Infantry, British Special Ops, and Marine with Machine Gun.[80]

Find Makarov: Operation Kingfish is a fan-made prequel to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and was first shown at Call of Duty XP. The video was produced by We Can Pretend, with visual effects by The Junction, and was endorsed by Activision.

Films
On November 6, 2015, upon the release of Black Ops III, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Activision Blizzard launched a production studio called Activision Blizzard Studios and are planning a live action Call of Duty cinematic universe in 2019.[82] On February 16, 2018, it was announced that Stefano Sollima will direct the film. Days later, he told Metro UK that he is considering having both Tom Hardy and Chris Pine as the leads for the film.[83][84] In an interview with FilmSlash, Sollima stated that the film will be a real soldier movie, not a war movie.[85] On November 27, 2018, it was announced that Joe Robert Cole will be writing the sequel.[86] Filming of the first film was supposed to start in Spring 2019 for a 2020 or 2021 release.[87] In February 2020, Sollima revealed in an interview that the film had been put on hold as it was not Activision's priority.[88]

In September 2025, Paramount Pictures announced that they and Microsoft owned Activision have inked deal that will see the studio develop, produce and distribute a live-action film based on the Call of Duty franchise.[89] In October 2025, it was announced that Peter Berg has been attached to direct, with Taylor Sheridan co-writing the screenplay and co-producing with Berg.[90]

Esports
The Call of Duty games were used in esports, starting in 2006, alongside the game released at the time, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.[91] Over the years, the series has extended with releases such as Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, Call of Duty: Ghosts, and Call of Duty: Mobile. Games are played in leagues like Major League Gaming.

Players can compete in ladders or tournaments. The ladders are divided into several sub ladders such as the singles ladder, doubles ladder, team ladder (3v3 – 6v6) and hardcore team ladder (3v3 – 6v6). The difference between the regular team ladder and the hardcore team ladder is the in-game settings and thus a rule differentiation. Winning ladder matches on a competitive website rewards the user with experience points which add up to give them an overall rank.[92]

The tournaments offered on these websites provide players with the opportunity to win cash prizes and trophies. The trophies are registered and saved on the player's profile if/when they win a tournament, and the prize money is deposited into his or her bank account. Call of Duty: Ghosts was the most competitively played game in 2014, with an average of 15,000 teams participating every season.[93]

For the past 6 seasons in competitive Call of Duty, Full Sail University has hosted a prize giveaway, giving $2,500 to the top team each season.[94] The other ladders give out credits and medals registered on players' profiles. Tournaments hosted on the Call of Duty: Ghosts's Arena give cost from 15 to 30 credits, thus averaging at a cost of about $18.75 per tournament. If the player competes with a team, the prize money is divided, and an equal cut is given to each player. Other tournaments with substantial prizes are hosted in specific cities and countries for LAN teams.

The biggest Call of Duty tournament hosted was Call of Duty: Experience 2011, a tournament that began when Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was released.[95]

Playing Call of Duty competitively is most popular in Europe and North America, with users who participate in tournaments and ladder matches daily.[96]

Activision launched a 12 team Call of Duty League, following a similar city-based franchise structure as the Overwatch League, in January 2020. The league's teams include those from Atlanta, Boston, the Carolinas, Las Vegas, Miami, Minnesota, New York, Seattle, Texas and Toronto, and with two teams from Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Thieves and Los Angeles Guerrillas.[97]

Call of Duty Endowment
The Call of Duty Endowment (CODE) is a nonprofit foundation created by Activision Blizzard to help find employment for U.S. military veterans. The first donation, consisting of $125,000, was presented to the Paralyzed Veterans of America.[98]

Co-chairman General James L. Jones is a former U.S. National Security Advisor.[99] Founder Robert Kotick is the CEO of Activision Blizzard. Upon its founding in 2009, the organization announced a commitment to create thousands of career opportunities for veterans, including those returning from the Middle East.[100] Annual awards given by the endowment include the "Seal of Distinction", a $30,000 initial grant given to selected veteran's service organizations.[101] In November 2014, the endowment launched the "Race to 1,000 Jobs" campaign to encourage gamers to donate money to and get involved in organizations that provide veterans with services.[102] As of 2015, the Call of Duty Endowment had provided around $12 million in grants to veterans' organizations in the United States, which has helped find jobs for 14,700 veterans.[103]

On March 30, 2010, CODE presented 3,000 copies of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, approximately $180,000 in value, to the U.S. Navy. The copies were delivered to over 300 ships and submarines as well as Navy Morale, Welfare, and Recreation facilities worldwide.[104]

Criticism, controversies, and legal actions
Accusations of stereotyping and Western bias
The Call of Duty series has been the subject of criticism for its "western-centric worldview, clumsy stereotyping and fetishisation of military power", according to The Guardian's Keith Stuart.[105] Writing for GameSpot, Phil Hornshall said the series "usually comes off as pro-gun and pro-military at the very least, and even jingoistic."[106] Sam Biddle of The New Yorker wrote that the series maintains "massive bipartisan appeal" owing to its "reactionary nature". He criticized Activision Blizzard's claim that the games were apolitical, writing they "now pushed so deeply into the territory of right-wing fantasy that it reaches a point of inadvertent parody".[107] Similarly, PC Gamer's Tyler Wilde criticized marketing that Call of Duty: WWII was made from anti-war sentiment and that playing as a virtual soldier could increase empathy; he felt through the game's announcement trailer it instead glorified a "brutal but noble" conflict in a game series that was no deeper than an action drama.[108]

Others have faulted Call of Duty's representation of ethnic and religious groups. Kotaku's Alyssa Mercante, alongside several Muslim and Arab members of the games industry, thought the series "historically dehumanize[s]" the aforementioned groups with harmful stereotypes and narratives. This included portraying the Middle East as undesirable where "the line between truth and fiction can blur", and creating localized fictional regions in a way that "perpetuat[es] the idea that there is a singular, Middle Eastern country".[109] Inverse's Gregory Lawrence felt that Call of Duty avoided accusations of Islamophobia by including "good" Muslim characters, but without further exploring their morality.[110] Writing for The Progressive, Joe Mayall thought that the games' depiction of its antagonists as anti-Western was a "dangerous oversimplification", the same attitude of which had led to the United States' (US) participation in wars.[111]

A perceived strong Western bias in the series has been a point of criticism.[109][111][112][113] TheGamer's Tessa Kaur condemned its portrayal of war that she thought depicted U.S. soldiers as heroes while having "no moral quandary", being "distinctively pro-intervention", and "perpetuat[ing] false beliefs" about real-world conflicts. Kaur questioned if the games could ever move beyond glorifying the U.S. military to tell "impactful and honest stories about the cruelty of war".[112] Mayall wrote Call of Duty "exaggerates the effectiveness and cleanliness of militarism while understating the repercussions", leaving audiences with a heavily skewed version of reality. He felt this did the most harm by portraying military intervention as the best form of foreign policy.[111] Conversely, Lawrence thought that the series had a surprising indifference in presenting the U.S. military favorably; he cited the rebooted Modern Warfare sub-series involving player-characters serving "corrupt masters embedded in a corrupt operation run by more corrupt masters".[110]

Some have linked the sensed partiality with the U.S. government's military–entertainment complex. Kaur wrote Call of Duty was one example of entertainment media the authorities had exploited since World War II to promote certain narratives in their favor;[112] Mayall noted the Pentagon had consulted on "more than a thousand movies and dozens of video games".[111] Alan MacLeod, a writer on the subject of propaganda, suggested that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II was a "psychological operation" for the US.[113] Affiliations between Call of Duty staff and the U.S. government have been felt to contribute to this.[112][113][114] In an interview with The Guardian, Call of Duty: Black Ops II writer Dave Anthony said how he was contacted by a former Pentagon official to join an expert panel to discuss the future of warfare. He consequently joined a Washington-based think tank that advises on the future of unknown conflicts and threats.[114] Similarly, while plotting Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Michael Condrey of Sledgehammer Games revealed the studio had consulted with a Pentagon advisor to discuss the likeliest future military threat to the US.[111][114][115] Some wrote of how Call of Duty had also been used as a recruitment tool by the U.S. military.[112][113] Kaur said they had once considered plans to grow its audience by paying Call of Duty streamers and organising esports tournaments involving soldiers and streamers; they had backed out when reports of sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard were publicized.[112]

Fallout with Infinity Ward leadership
Main article: Infinity Ward
As Infinity Ward's founders Jason West and Vince Zampella started new contract negotiations to continue developing the Call of Duty Activision around 2007, a number of legal issues arose between Infinity Ward and Activision. Ultimately, West and Zampella were forced out of Infinity Ward, later forming Respawn Entertainment within Electronic Arts. West and Zampella, as well as several Infinity Ward staff that departed the studio alongside them to join Respawn, filed lawsuits against Activision related to unpaid royalties and bonuses.

No Russian
Main article: No Russian
Modern Warfare 2 received significant controversy due to its inclusion of the level "No Russian", in which the player participates in a massacre of civilians at a Russian airport.

Trademark infringement claims by AM General
AM General, the manufacturer of the Humvee, sued Activision in 2017 for using the Humvee in multiple Call of Duty games.[116] A federal district judge gave Activision a summary motion in its favor to dismiss the case in April 2020, stating that the purpose of the use of the Humvee in the games, to provide military realism, was quite different from the trademark purpose that AM General had established, for selling to the military.[117]
